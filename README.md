## 🔍 Project Overview

As part of my internship project, I worked on simulating and analyzing two critical Red Team tools:

### 🔴 Metasploit
A powerful framework used to develop and execute exploit code against remote systems.

### 🔴 Mimikatz
A post-exploitation tool used to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Perform a simulated attack using Metasploit on a test environment
- Use Mimikatz to extract credentials from the victim machine
- Document all steps, tools, and findings in both PoC and report
